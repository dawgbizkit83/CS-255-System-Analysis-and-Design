# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design



    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The DriverPass project involved me working for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle these needs. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    Over the course of several weeks, I feel that my strong point was reviewing the transcript from the interview process and determing the needs of the client. After reviewing the transcript I was able to complete the system design document which I feel was the strongest part of my project.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    The one part of my work that I would revise would be the sections regarding the funtional and non-functional requirements. I would review the course material and transcripts again to have a better understaing of what each is and pick more specific functional and non-functional points to discuss.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    By reviewing the transcript I was able to understand the user's needs. The project lead Jennifer did a great job asking the necessary questions to start the design process. Her questions and the user's answers are what I used for the system design. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because you are developing a product for a customer. If you don't listen to their needs and wants, you will be designing something that they will not be happy with and will not sign off on. Ultimately, you would be wasting your time. You need to understand the customer, have communication with them, and disucss what the end goals will be.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    In order to design software, you need to have an idea of what the user's needs are. You do this by conducting an interview and ask questions to the user.
    After the interview you can build a system design document. This will lay out the design for the user so they have an understanding of what all the details will be.
